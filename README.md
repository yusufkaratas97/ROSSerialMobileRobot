# ROSSerialMobileRobot
basic simulation using turtleboot with real mobile robot at same time using Arduino boards

### Arduino framwark node
  - sender: the .ino code of the arduino board which connected to the PC.
  - reciver: the .ino code of the arduino board located on the robot.
### ROS nodes
  - keyboard: allows you to control the robot using the keboard.
  - odometry: sending the data via ROSSerial to the Arduino board connected to the PC.
